# Multithreaded Task Scheduler in C++

This project implements a robust and efficient multithreaded task scheduler in C++. It's designed to handle tasks with priorities and dependencies, leveraging a thread pool for concurrent execution.

## Features

* **Task Abstraction:** Define and execute various types of tasks.
* **Thread Pool:** Manages a configurable number of worker threads.
* **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Tasks with higher priority are executed first.
* **Dependency Management:** Ensures tasks only run after their prerequisites are met.
* **Flexible API:** Easy to integrate into other C++ applications.

## Directory Structure

* `include/`: Header files for the scheduler library.
* `src/`: Source files for the scheduler implementation.
* `tests/`: Unit and integration tests to ensure correctness.
* `examples/`: Demonstrations of how to use the scheduler.
* `benchmarks/`: Performance and stress tests.

## Building the Project
